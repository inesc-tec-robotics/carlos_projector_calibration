3D ScANNING SOFTWARE BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

The software requires Qt and OpencV libraries. It should run on any system that 
satisfies those requirements. It has been developed and tested using Qt 4.8.4 
and OpencV 2.4.3 in Microsoft Windows 7. It has also been tried in Mac OS X and 
while it builds and runs fine no extensive testing has been done on this platform.

Feel free to modify the paths on top of 'build/scan3d-capture.pro'.
